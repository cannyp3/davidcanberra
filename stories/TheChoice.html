        <p>The fluorescent lights of the Oakhaven MegaMart cast long, stark shadows across Mark Henderson's sweating face. He wrung his hands, the plastic of his manager's badge digging into his palm. "It's just... it's getting worse," he stammered, his voice a strained whisper. "The, uh, the incidents. They're happening more often. And they're… bolder."</p>
<p>The expert leaned against a stack of discounted garden gnomes, his expression one of patient resignation. "Bolder, you say?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Last week, a customer swore the sink turned on by itself and sprayed him. Another one said all the hand dryers started blasting at once, even though nobody was near them. And just this morning," Henderson’s voice dropped even lower, as if the very air could be haunted, "a roll of paper towels flew across the room and hit a customer right in the face. He's threatening to sue."</p>
<p>"Paper towel assault," the expert murmured, chewing on his ever-present toothpick. "Classic escalation."</p>
<p>"The business is… well, you can see for yourself," Henderson gestured vaguely at the sparsely populated aisles. "People are avoiding the second floor. Some are avoiding the store altogether. We’ve tried everything. Blessings, sage, that fella who claimed to be a 'paranormal influencer' – he just live-streamed himself crying in a stall for three hours."</p>
<p>The expert pushed himself off the gnomes. "Alright, Henderson. Show me the… theater of the absurd."</p>
<p>Henderson led him nervously towards a set of double doors marked "Restrooms." A neatly printed sign reading "Closed for Cleaning" hung from the handle of the men's room. "We’ve kept it closed since the incident this morning.”</p>
<p>The expert nodded, his gaze already distant. "I’ll take it from here. Shouldn’t take long." He pulled open the door and stepped inside.</p>
<p>The air within the restroom was noticeably colder. The fluorescent lights hummed with the same oppressive monotony as the rest of the store. For a moment, nothing happened. The expert stood just inside the entrance, his hands in his pockets, surveying the scene with a practiced indifference.</p>
<p>Then, a low rattling sound emanated from one of the toilet paper dispensers. Before he could fully register it, the roll within spun violently, unraveling a length of cheap, thin paper that snaked across the tiled floor. Simultaneously, the door to one of the stalls slammed shut with a sharp <em>bang</em>.</p>
<p>He remained still, his gaze steady. Another stall door creaked open slowly, revealing an empty toilet bowl. Then, with surprising force, it slammed shut again. The erratic activity continued for a few moments – a paper towel dispenser whirred briefly, releasing a single, folded towel onto the wet floor; the faucet on one of the sinks sputtered and dripped, then fell silent. The expert simply smirked.</p>
<p>Frustration seemed to emanate from the very walls. The temperature dropped another degree. With a ripple in the air, a translucent figure shimmered into existence in the center of the room. It was a boy, no older than nine or ten, his spectral clothes clinging to a vaguely bloated form. Phantom droplets of water fell from his dark hair, hitting the already damp tiles with a faint <em>plink</em>. His wide, dark eyes glared at the expert, a mixture of resentment and exasperation in their depths.</p>
<p>The expert finally moved, strolling casually towards a urinal and peering inside. "So, this is the main office," he mused, then turned his gaze on the apparition. "Why here? You don't like people getting deals on shitty plastic shovels and overpriced fertilizer?"</p>
<p>The boy's form wavered, and the lights above flickered erratically. A roll of toilet paper rocketed from a stall, narrowly missing the expert’s head.</p>
<p>"You don't know who you're dealing with, buddy," came the boy’s voice. It was a chilling, layered whisper that seemed to emanate from the very pipes in the walls.</p>
<p>The expert didn't even flinch. He plucked the toothpick from his mouth, pointing it at the spectral child like a conductor's baton. "Cute. Must work wonders on the regulars." A smirk ghosted across his lips. "Want to see something from the professional ranks?"</p>
<p>He nodded towards the fogged mirror above the sinks. For a moment, his reflection was just that—a man in a rumpled suit. Then, the image began to warp, not flickering like the ghost, but melting like wax held to a flame. Small, black horns curled from his temples. His eyes bled into pools of molten gold, and his smile widened to reveal teeth just a little too sharp, a little too predatory. The reflection was no longer human. It was a demon, ancient and commanding, and the aura of absolute authority radiated from the man standing very solidly on the tile.</p>
<p>The boy recoiled, his spectral arrogance shattering into genuine terror. The temperature in the room plunged, and the puddles on the floor hissed into steam around the expert's worn leather shoes. The ghost darted towards the far wall, attempting to phase through, but slammed against the ceramic with a wet, sickening squelch. He was trapped.</p>
<p>"Listen, Casper," the expert said, his voice now holding a resonant power that scraped at the edges of reality. "You clearly don't know the rules of haunting. You can't just leave. You're stuck here unless someone like me removes you… or if you make a hard choice."</p>
<p>The boy, now a huddled, shimmering mass in the corner, looked small and truly lost. "What choice?" he whimpered.</p>
<p>"You can choose to move on," the expert said, his reflection mercifully returning to its mundane form. "Live in peace and be forgotten in a few years." He let the option hang in the frigid air. "Or... You come with me and start a new life giving lost souls like you a chance."</p>
<p>The boy’s fear gave way to confusion. "You want me to work for you? Why me?"</p>
<p>A deep, genuine laugh escaped the expert. "It’s complicated, kid."</p>
<p>"When would I get out?" the boy asked, his voice barely a whisper.</p>
<p>"Oh, the option to move on will always be yours. I can't take that away. I'd just be buying you time," the expert explained. "You can always stay here and haunt the Second Floor Men's Restroom." He glanced at a decidedly non-digital watch on his wrist. "But I've got other things to do. There's the spirit of a 35-year-old single woman occupying the back booth of a diner down in Dallas. I heard it's where her heart was broken. I've gotta get moving if I want to beat traffic."</p>
<p>The boy looked down at his own dripping, see-through hands. "Would I stay looking like this?"</p>
<p>"What, the bloated fish look?!" The expert chuckled. "That would be an interesting marketing tactic. As tempting as it would be to have someone with your marine complexion, I would prefer a new look. In fact: an entirely new identity."</p>
<p>"You mean… I wouldn't be me anymore?"</p>
<p>"Is that what you want?" the expert asked, his tone softening as he took a step closer. "Let me ask you something: how far away did you grow up from here? About five, maybe ten miles?"</p>
<p>The boy gave a slow, spectral nod. "Yeah. Something like that."</p>
<p>"And your family shopped here?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Even after you got lost here when you were seven and experienced your first true fear in life? They found you in here, right?"</p>
<p>The boy's form flickered, not with anger, but with a deep, forgotten shame. "...Yeah."</p>
<p>"What would you do if your father walked in here one day?" the expert pressed gently. "Would you run through your little poltergeist routine? Would you show your face? Would you want him to know that, instead of resting in peace like he and the rest of your devastated family have wanted since they lost you, you were scaring random men while they were taking a leak?"</p>
<p>"...I... I never thought..." the boy stammered, the words catching in his ethereal throat.</p>
<p>"It's OK, kid. I'm not trying to lay some guilt trip on you. I just wanted you to be fully aware of your situation. And I'm not saying your old man will walk through this door any time soon. But I'm not saying he won't. Is that worth the risk?"</p>
<p>"What risk? I'm not gonna scare my dad!" the boy cried, a phantom sob echoing in the room.</p>
<p>"So you'd just stay silent? You wouldn't want to talk to him? Remember: you're stuck here, like this."</p>
<p>"Oh... I..." The poltergeist facade crumbled completely, revealing the terrified child beneath.</p>
<p>"Again," the expert said, his voice soft but firm. "Is it worth it?"</p>
<p>A long silence stretched, punctuated only by the drip of spectral water. Finally, the boy shook his head. "No. It's not." He looked up, his dark eyes holding a flicker of something new: hope. "So… do I, like, sign something?"</p>
<p>The expert's laugh was warm this time. "Were you expecting some sort of paperwork? Ha! Nah, kid. Nothing like that. You just need to walk through that door." He gestured to the restroom entrance.</p>
<p>The boy looked from the demon to the door. "Like… literally just…"</p>
<p>"Yup. Walk through the door. Once you're through, you'll be a new man. I'll even let you pick your new name."</p>
<p>The boy straightened, his form solidifying, the watery translucence receding. He took a hesitant step, then another. "Michael," he said, his voice clear and steady for the first time. "I want to be Michael."</p>
<p>"Ah. Good name. An improvement," the expert nodded.</p>
<p>As the boy reached the threshold, he paused and looked back. "What do I call you?"</p>
<p>"Dux. My name is Dux."</p>
<p>The boy nodded, then pushed the door open and stepped out. Henderson jumped back, his eyes wide. He saw Dux emerge, followed by a young man who looked to be in his late teens, with dry hair and wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans. He was solid, real, and decidedly not dripping. The oppressive cold in the hallway vanished, replaced by the warm, stale air of the MegaMart.</p>
<p>Michael blinked, looking at his own solid hands in wonder before turning to Dux with a broad, disbelieving grin.</p>
<p>"Okay Dux," Michael said, "where to?"</p>
<p>Dux clapped him firmly on the shoulder, his own smile revealing those slightly-too-sharp teeth. "Oh, I wasn't joking about the diner lady down in Dallas. Let's go, Michael."</p>
<p>They walked off down the aisle, past the discounted patio furniture and the rows of weed killer, leaving a stunned Henderson staring into a bathroom that was, for the first time in six months, completely and blessedly empty.</p>
