        <h1>The Choice</h1>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The fluorescent lights of the Oakhaven MegaMart cast long, stark shadows across Mark Henderson&#39;s sweating face. He wrung his hands, the plastic of his manager&#39;s badge digging into his palm. &quot;It&#39;s just... it&#39;s getting worse,&quot; he stammered, his voice a strained whisper. &quot;The, uh, the incidents. They&#39;re happening more often. And they&#39;re&hellip; more... aggressive.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The expert leaned against a stack of discounted garden gnomes, his expression one of patient resignation. &quot;More aggressive, you say?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yes! Last week, a customer swore the sink turned on by itself and sprayed him. Another one said all the hand dryers started blasting at once, even though nobody was near them. And just this morning,&quot; Henderson&rsquo;s voice dropped even lower, as if the very air could be haunted, &quot;a roll of paper towels flew across the room and hit Harold from Accounting right in the face. He&#39;s threatening to sue.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Paper towel assault,&quot; the expert murmured, chewing on his ever-present toothpick. &quot;Classic escalation.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;The business is&hellip; well, you can see for yourself,&quot; Henderson gestured vaguely at the sparsely populated aisles. &quot;People are avoiding the second floor. Some are avoiding the store altogether. We&rsquo;ve tried everything. Blessings, sage, that fella who claimed to be a &#39;paranormal influencer&#39; &ndash; he just live-streamed himself crying in a stall for three hours.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The expert pushed himself off the gnomes. &quot;Alright, Henderson. Show me the&hellip; theater of the absurd.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Henderson led him nervously towards a set of double doors marked &quot;Restrooms.&quot; A neatly printed sign reading &quot;Closed for Cleaning&quot; hung from the handle of the men&#39;s room. &quot;We&rsquo;ve kept it closed since the incident this morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The expert nodded, his gaze already distant. &quot;I&rsquo;ll take it from here. Shouldn&rsquo;t take long.&quot; He pulled open the door and stepped inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The air within the restroom was noticeably colder, carrying a faint, earthy smell that hinted at damp soil and stagnant water. The fluorescent lights hummed with the same oppressive monotony as the rest of the store. For a moment, nothing happened. The expert stood just inside the entrance, his hands in his pockets, surveying the scene with a practiced indifference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Then, a low rattling sound emanated from one of the toilet paper dispensers. Before he could fully register it, the roll within spun violently, unraveling a length of cheap, thin paper that snaked across the tiled floor. Simultaneously, the door to one of the stalls slammed shut with a sharp </span><span class="c2">bang</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He remained still, his gaze steady. Another stall door creaked open slowly, revealing an empty toilet bowl. Then, with surprising force, it slammed shut again. The erratic activity continued for a few moments &ndash; a paper towel dispenser whirred briefly, releasing a single, folded towel onto the wet floor; the faucet on one of the sinks sputtered and dripped, then fell silent. The expert simply smirked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Frustration seemed to emanate from the very walls. The temperature dropped another degree. With a ripple in the air, a translucent figure shimmered into existence in the center of the room. It was a boy, no older than nine or ten, his spectral clothes clinging to a vaguely bloated form. Phantom droplets of water fell from his dark hair, hitting the already damp tiles with a faint </span><span class="c2">plink</span><span class="c0">. His wide, dark eyes glared at the expert, a mixture of resentment and exasperation in their depths.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The expert finally moved, strolling casually towards a urinal and peering inside. &quot;So, this is the main office,&quot; he mused, then turned his gaze on the apparition. &quot;Why here? You don&#39;t like people getting deals on shitty plastic shovels and overpriced fertilizer?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy&#39;s form wavered, and the lights above flickered erratically. A roll of toilet paper rocketed from a stall, narrowly missing the expert&rsquo;s head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You don&#39;t know who you&#39;re dealing with, buddy,&quot; came the boy&rsquo;s voice. It was a chilling, layered whisper that seemed to emanate from the very pipes in the walls.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The expert didn&#39;t even flinch. He plucked the toothpick from his mouth, pointing it at the spectral child like a conductor&#39;s baton. &quot;Cute. Must work wonders on the regulars.&quot; A smirk ghosted across his lips. &quot;Want to see something from the professional ranks?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded towards the fogged mirror above the sinks. For a moment, his reflection was just that&mdash;a man in a rumpled suit. Then, the image began to warp, not flickering like the ghost, but melting like wax held to a flame. Small, black horns curled from his temples. His eyes bled into pools of molten gold, and his smile widened to reveal teeth just a little too sharp, a little too predatory. The reflection was no longer human. It was a demon, ancient and commanding, and the aura of absolute authority radiated from the man standing very solidly on the tile.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy recoiled, his spectral arrogance shattering into genuine terror. The temperature in the room plunged, and the puddles on the floor hissed into steam around the expert&#39;s worn leather shoes. The ghost darted towards the far wall, attempting to phase through, but slammed against the ceramic with a wet, sickening squelch. He was trapped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Listen, Casper,&quot; the expert said, his voice now holding a resonant power that scraped at the edges of reality. &quot;You clearly don&#39;t know the rules of haunting. You can&#39;t just leave. You&#39;re stuck here unless someone like me removes you&hellip; or if you make a hard choice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy, now a huddled, shimmering mass in the corner, looked small and truly lost. &quot;What choice?&quot; he whimpered.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You can choose to move on,&quot; the expert said, his reflection mercifully returning to its mundane form. &quot;Live in peace and be forgotten in a few years.&quot; He let the option hang in the frigid air. &quot;Or... You come with me and start a new life giving lost souls like you a chance.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy&rsquo;s fear gave way to confusion. &quot;A job? Wouldn&#39;t they just end up working for you, too?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A deep, genuine laugh escaped the expert. &quot;It&#39;s not that simple, kid.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;When would I get out?&quot; the boy asked, his voice barely a whisper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh, the option to move on00 will always be yours. I can&#39;t take that away. I&#39;d just be buying you time,&quot; the expert explained. &quot;You can always stay here and haunt the Second Floor Men&#39;s Restroom.&quot; He glanced at a decidedly non-digital watch on his wrist. &quot;But I&#39;ve got other things to do. There&#39;s the spirit of a 35-year-old single woman occupying the back booth of a diner down in Dallas. I heard it&#39;s where her heart was broken. I&#39;ve gotta get moving if I want to beat traffic.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy looked down at his own dripping, see-through hands. &quot;Would I stay looking like this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What, the bloated fish aethetic?!&quot; The expert chuckled. &quot;That would be an interesting marketing tactic. As tempting as it would be to have someone with your marine complexion, I would prefer a new look. In fact: an entirely new identity.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;You mean&hellip; I wouldn&#39;t be me anymore?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Is that what you want?&quot; the expert asked, his tone softening as he took a step closer. &quot;Let me ask you something: how far away did you grow up from here? About five, maybe ten miles?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy gave a slow, spectral nod. &quot;Yeah. Something like that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;And your family shopped here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Even after you got lost here when you were seven and experienced your first true fear in life? They found you in here, right?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy&#39;s form flickered, not with anger, but with a deep, forgotten shame. &quot;...Yeah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What would you do if your father walked in here one day?&quot; the expert pressed gently. &quot;Would you run through your little poltergeist routine? Would you show your face? Would you want him to know that, instead of resting in peace like he and the rest of your devastated family have wanted since they lost you, you were scaring random men while they were taking a leak?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;...I... I never thought...&quot; the boy stammered, the words catching in his ethereal throat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;It&#39;s OK, kid. I&#39;m not trying to lay some guilt trip on you. I just wanted you to be fully aware of your situation. And I&#39;m not saying your old man will walk through this door any time soon. But I&#39;m not saying he won&#39;t. Is that worth the risk?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;What risk? I&#39;m not gonna scare my dad!&quot; the boy cried, a phantom sob echoing in the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;So you&#39;d just stay silent? You wouldn&#39;t want to talk to him? Remember: you&#39;re stuck here, like this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Oh... I...&quot; The poltergeist facade crumbled completely, revealing the terrified child beneath.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Again,&quot; the expert said, his voice soft but firm. &quot;Is it worth it?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A long silence stretched, punctuated only by the drip of spectral water. Finally, the boy shook his head. &quot;No. It&#39;s not.&quot; He looked up, his dark eyes holding a flicker of something new: hope. &quot;So&hellip; do I, like, sign something?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The expert&#39;s laugh was warm this time. &quot;Were you expecting some sort of paperwork? Ha! Nah, kid. Nothing like that. You just need to walk through that door.&quot; He gestured to the restroom entrance.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy looked from the demon to the door. &quot;Like&hellip; literally just&hellip;&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Yup. Walk through the door. Once you&#39;re through, you&#39;ll be a new man. I&#39;ll even let you pick your new name.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy straightened, his form solidifying, the watery translucence receding. He took a hesitant step, then another. &quot;Michael,&quot; he said, his voice clear and steady for the first time. &quot;I want to be Michael.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ah. Good name. An improvement,&quot; the expert nodded.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the boy reached the threshold, he paused and looked back. &quot;What do I call you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Dux. My name is Dux.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy nodded, then pushed the door open and stepped out. Henderson jumped back, his eyes wide. He saw Dux emerge, followed by a young man who looked to be in his late teens, with dry hair and wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans. He was solid, real, and decidedly not dripping. The oppressive cold in the hallway vanished, replaced by the warm, stale air of the MegaMart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Michael blinked, looking at his own solid hands in wonder before turning to Dux with a broad, disbelieving grin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Okay Dux,&quot; Michael said, &quot;where to?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dux clapped him firmly on the shoulder, his own smile revealing those slightly-too-sharp teeth. &quot;Oh, I wasn&#39;t joking about the diner lady down in Dallas. Let&#39;s go, Michael.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They walked off down the aisle, past the discounted patio furniture and the rows of weed killer, leaving a stunned Henderson staring into a bathroom that was, for the first time in six months, completely and blessedly empty.</span></p></body>
